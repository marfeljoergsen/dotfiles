# --- Test command (ctrl+C to break) ---
# compton --config ~/.config/compton.conf

#From the compton man page:
#    --opacity-rule OPACITY:'CONDITION'
#
#    Specify a list of opacity rules, in the format PERCENT:PATTERN,
#    like 50:name *="Firefox". compton-trans is recommended over
#    this. Note we do not distinguish 100% and unset, and we donâ€™t make
#    any guarantee about possible conflicts with other programs that
#    set _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY on frame or client windows.

# Below sets 93% opacity for termite:
# opacity-rule = ["93:class_g = 'Termite'"];

# Below sets opacity for several apps:
opacity-rule = [
             "91:class_g = 'Termite'",
             "94:class_g = 'Emacs'"];
